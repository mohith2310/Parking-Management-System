#Secure-Car-Parking-Management-System

1.Introduction :

Car parking has become an immense issue, especially in big cities. Moreover, the car theft has become an evil art haunting
drivers. Our approach is cost effective and it covers all the
features of a complete secure car parking management system.

2.Car Entering Module :

In this Module, as the car enters the lot, it is detected by the IR
Sensors. The IR Sensors provide the pulse to the FPGA which
assumes that an input is detected and thus the car is allocated
a parking lot(if there is a free slot). Now the user is given a
smart card which represents a particular slot.One should set
one’s own password for their card and he/she is supposed to
re-enter the password once again near the slot,so that we can
ensure that he/she is parking their car in the correct slot,they
are also supposed to place their car keys in respective lockers
assigned for each slot.

3.Car Exiting Module :

In this module, when the card is scanned while exiting one
should re-enter the same password that he/she assigned while
entering into the slot to collect one’s key,so that one can take
their car.

4.Car Security:

The security module is highly secure enough so that one cannot
lose their key, even if they lose their smart card,the car keys are
still in locker so that the management can assure that the car is
safe.there are no reasons to be concerned about even if the
card is lost.
